# congestion-aware-facility-layout-optimization
An LP formulation is implemented using Gurobiâ€™s C++ interface to optimize facility layouts when congestion risk has to be taken into account, along with the objective of minimizing travel distances. It addresses the problem of congestion-aware layout planning without enforcing the paths taken between facilities. This is achieved by considering the relative positioning of facilities. It's noted that congestion risk is particularly significant when facilities 'i' and 'j' are positioned similarly in relation to facility 'k,' indicating a higher likelihood of overlapping movements.
The formulation is intended for locating unequal-sized rectangular facilities in a 2D environment. By using rectilinear distances and only four positioning descriptors (left, right, up, below), the formulation is kept linear and small, enabling quick solutions.
